"""Force feedback (SPEC 5): device backends and the engine that turns game events
and the Snapshot into effects.

The engine owns every safety rule; a backend only talks to the device. Engine
units: magnitudes 0..1 (constant levels -1..1, sign = direction), seconds, wheel
degrees. Backends take milliseconds and spring centres as -1..1 of the full
wheel axis (lock to lock). Effect slots are named; each has one effect type.

Safety pipeline, every frame:
1. Each effect: strength (settings) then its cap -> pre-gain magnitude.
2. Budget (rule 6): one-shots together <= ONESHOT_BUDGET, all active effects
   together <= BUDGET. Over budget, ramped effects are scaled down first, then
   one-shots get less.
3. Ramp (rule 2): pre-gain values and the effective gain each slew at a quarter
   of the limit, so their product never moves more than RAMP_LIMIT in RAMP_WINDOW.
   Kick and beat pulse step, within STEP_CAP. Only stop_all is immediate.
4. Gain (rule 1): output = pre-gain value * effective gain (0..1).
Step sizes use the engine's own clock, never more than the caller's dt. That
clock must be wall time (time.perf_counter), never the song clock.

Centres follow the turn offset (SPEC 9 rule 10): every spring centre adds
Snapshot.steer_offset_deg; while Snapshot.steer_unwind is true only the damper runs,
and during an active spin (`update(..., spinning=True)`) the weight spring lets go.
